# Use case
An organisation can create a personal space, where they can publish projects that need funding. They can also invite a member that administrates this project.
People can browse several organisation and if they like decide to fund the project of a particular org.
Upon fundinf they receive a nft that is associated to this project which acts as a tamahochi.

That is one must care about its tamagochi by participating in given events (== further donating to the associated beneficial project)
The NFT can be collected.



## Tamagochi

Each tamagochi has a unique brand, partly set by the org
    - for what does the tamagochi fight
    - information about project
    - how any team mates are there (others that fund the same)
  
Tamagochi can be developed by the following ways:
    - feed, train udn educate the tamagochi (basic traits)
    - participate in events (puplished by the org)
    - supply tamagochi with items from the ingame shop

Tamagochis grow, become better, cuter and more unique the more one invests


## Monthly Events (Whos the coolest tamagochi)
All tamagochis can participate in this event (registration fee)
There is a public vote who is the coolest
Voting costs a bit of a fee,
the winner gains some extra doantion for his organisation (organisation of his tamagochi)



Organisation may can receive ether/donations itself
Anything that goes into the pot will be distributed equally to all organisation

Question: who executes the payout? Me? Can anyone at anytime request a timeout?
